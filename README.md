## :rocket: Project Setup Locally

> I used Youtube Data API to get videos and channels data. To run this app locally, you have to get API key.

Put your API key inside .env file:

```
API_KEY={your api key}
```

Run npm install to install required packages for frontend:

```
cd client
npm install
```

Run npm install to install required packages for node.js server in root directory:

```
npm install
```

Start node.js server in root directory:
```
node server.js
```

Start react:
```
cd client
npm start
```
